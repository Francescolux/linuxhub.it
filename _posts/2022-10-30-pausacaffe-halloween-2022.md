Spooky, scary **linux distros**  
`apt install` down your spine  
*Flatpak* will shock your soul  
Seal your *container* tonight  

Spooky, scary **linux distros**  
Speak with such a screech  
You'll `dnf list installed` in surprise  
When you hear these *zombie processes*.  

We're sorry **linux distros**, you're so misunderstood  
You only want to *upgrade the system*, but I don't think we should  

because `your keyring is too out of date`  
to install some packages.  
They'll sneak from their *package manager*  
And just won't leave you be  

`pacman` is shy what's all the fuss?  
But *bugs* of *Plasma* seem so unsafe, it's semi-serious  

Spooky, scary **linux distros**  
Are silly all the same  
They'll smile and *lag* slowly by  
And drive you so insane  

*Gnomes* and *Tux* will break your bones  
They seldom let you snooze  
Spooky, scary **linux distros**  
Will wake you with a KERNEL PANIC
